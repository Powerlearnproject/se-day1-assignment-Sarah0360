Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer:  
     1. The Birth of Programming (1940s - 1950s)
In the early days, computers were massive machines, and programming was done using punch cards and machine code (binary numbers: 0s and 1s). Writing software was extremely difficult and time-consuming.
Key Development: The creation of higher-level programming languages like FORTRAN (1957) and COBOL (1959) made coding easier and more accessible.
Impact: Instead of writing complex machine code, programmers could now use words and symbols, making software development faster.

      2. The Rise of Software Engineering as a Discipline (1968)
Before the 1960s, software development was chaotic—projects often ran over budget, had errors, or failed completely. This led to the "Software Crisis," where demand for software grew faster than the ability to build it.
Key Development: In 1968, the first Software Engineering Conference was held to find better ways to manage software development.
Impact: Engineering principles, such as planning, testing, and teamwork, were introduced to improve software quality and efficiency.

      3. The Agile Revolution (2001 - Present)
Traditional software development methods, like the Waterfall model, were slow and rigid. As technology advanced, developers needed a faster way to build and improve software.
Key Development: In 2001, a group of developers created the Agile Manifesto, which emphasized flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
Impact: Agile methods, such as Scrum and DevOps, allow developers to quickly adapt to changes, leading to faster software releases and better user experiences.
